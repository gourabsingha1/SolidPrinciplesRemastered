## A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one responsibility or functionality.
- The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) does not mean a class should have only one function. Instead, it means a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should be responsible for a single functionality or cohesive set of behaviors.

# Responsibilities Are Separated:
- Arithmetic operations, validation, and logging are handled independently.

# Easier Testing:
- Each class can be tested in isolation.

# Extensibility:
- Adding new operations, validation rules, or logging mechanisms does not impact unrelated parts of the system.
